# Snake-game

This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🐍 The game features a minimalist design with a simple black background and a snake made of square cubes. Players control the snake using the arrow keys ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️, guiding it to eat randomly placed food on the game board. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases. 🍎 The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. 💥 The project demonstrates essential game development concepts, such as movement, collision detection, and score tracking. With its basic structure and clean design, this Snake game serves as an excellent introduction to creating interactive web applications using core web technologies. 🚀
